Description:    This   programming   project   is   a   custom   implementation   of   B+Tree.   It   has   the following   methods:

	1. Initialize(order)

	2. Insert(key,value) 

	3. Search(key)

	4. Search(key1,key2)

Note :   Since   B+Tree   are   often   referred   to   as   Btree   in   the   industry,   the   term   “Btree”   is   used instead   of      “B+Tree“,   both   in   this   document   and   in   the   code.

Steps   to   execute:

	-> Go   to   the   directory   with   the   java   files.

	-> Run   “make”   command   to   compile   the   java   files.

	-> Run   “java   treesearch   <input   file>”   command   to   execute   the   program.

	-> The   output   will   be   written   to   output_file.txt   in   the   same   directory.
